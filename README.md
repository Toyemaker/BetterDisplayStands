# BetterDisplayStands
A simple mod for PlateUp!

Ever thought that it seemed a bit ridiculous to need 16 display stands in a restaurant to only get a measly 99% chance for customers to order the items you want?

With this mod, you now have the power to change this!

From now on, you'll only ever need 1 display stand to get the same effect as an infinite number of display stands!

Requires BepInEx.
